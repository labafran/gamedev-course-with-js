    <h1>GameDev with Vanilla JS</h1>
    <p>
      So bassicly I'm taking a course for GameDev with vanilla HTML CSS and JS,
      I took it as a sign to learn and improve my JS skills since I've never
      touched it in deep and I was wanting to make a game
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellow all the classes I've take I'll leave a link to the youtube video in
      case you want it to take a peek
    </p>
    <p>
        This index.html is just to make some "menu", I'll make it more ✨Aesthetic✨ later
