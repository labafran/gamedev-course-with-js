# gamedev-course-with-js
I'm taking a game development course using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, so I decided to show my progress via GitHub.

I've doing 2 classes: 1st one was animating sprites, 2nd one was making a paralax animation

All the resourses belong to the respective creator, I'm using it only for educational purposes!
